Cabana
===

A WordPress base theme for Bluetent, based on Underscores. Uses Gulp for compiling, Autoprefixer and [Straight-up](https://github.com/kennethormandy/straight-up) (Neat, without Bourbon) for grids. Uses an CSS3 offcanvas navigation for mobile. Meant to be lightweight to quickly get your project up to speed, without getting in your way. This theme is not meant to be used as a parent theme, so get in there and make it bend to your will.
